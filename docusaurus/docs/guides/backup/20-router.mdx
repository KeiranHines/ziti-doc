## Recover

Routers are replaceable without a backup. You can use role attributes in your policies or
re-enroll an unavailable router.

### Recover Using Role Attributes

Policies that authorize routers with role attributes (e.g., `#some-role`), not mentions (e.g., `@router1`) will
authorize a replacement router with the same roles with the same privileges.

### Recover Using Re-enrollment

You can administratively re-enroll a router. This will invalidate the existing enrollment and existing policy grants
for the router's ID (e.g., `@router1`) will still be valid for the replacement.

## Backup

The router has two stateful elements: the configuration YAML file and the identity files mentioned in the configuration
file. The router will cache control plane information in the same directory as the configuration file, but it's not
essential to back it up as long as the configuration file points to a valid control plane endpoint.

### Identity Files

The router's identity files (keys and certs) uniquely identify the router to the controller. To recover a unique router
identity you must back up the files mentioned in the following configuration properties:

- `identity` may appear in several places and always configures keys and certs for the router

### Configuration YAML

The router's configuration YAML file is specified as a positional parameter when the router is run. You can edit the
file to change the filesystem path for any files that are restored to a new location.
