The OpenZiti Controller uses a [Bolt](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt) database to store its state. The database is a writeable file in a path specified by the controller's configuration property `db` ([link to config reference](/reference/30-configuration/controller.md#db)).

Use the controller's built-in database snapshot operation to preserve data integrity. The snapshot operation creates a snapshot file in the same filesystem directory as the main database file on the controller host.

The most relevant way to invoke the snapshot operation is with the `ziti` CLI, which calls the management API provided by the OpenZiti Controller ([link to reference](/reference/developer/api/02-edge-management-reference.mdx#tag/Database/operation/createDatabaseSnapshot)).
