This article is about deploying the console as a single-page application (SPA) embedded in the controller's API running in a container.

1. Configure the controller

    The console's `zac` binding must be on the same web listener as the controller's management API, i.e., the `edge-management` binding.

    ```text
          - binding: zac
            options:
              location: /ziti-console
              indexFile: index.html
    ```

    - `location` is the filesystem path to the static files of the console. In the controller container, the usual path is `/ziti-console`.
    - `indexFile` property is the entry point to the console.

1. To apply the changes, the controller must be restarted.
1. Visit the console at `/zac/` on the controller's address.

    The console is now available at `https://<fqdn>:<port>/zac/`.

1. Log in to the console.

    The only available authentication method for the console SPA is username and password.

1. Optionally, configure a console certificate.

    To set up a separate certificate for the console you must provide the certificate and key files in the controller's configuration YAML file in the `identity.alt_server_certs` property in the `web` listener where the `zac` binding is configured. Refer to [the configuration reference for the `identity` property](/reference/30-configuration/conventions.md#identity) for more information. You can skip this step if you want to use the console with the certificate that is already configured for the `edge-management` binding.
