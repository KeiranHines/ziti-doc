This article is about deploying a router as a Linux system service. [The router introduction](/learn/introduction/03-components.md#router) may be helpful to read first.

## Installation

The router package `openziti-router` provides a systemd service unit and optional bootstrapping. The package depends on the `openziti` package which provides the `ziti` CLI. The easiest way to install both is the cross-platform install script for RPM and Debian distributions.

Download and run the install script.

```text
wget https://get.openziti.io/install.bash
```

Install interactively so that you will have an opportunity to answer questions about generating a configuration.

```text
sudo bash ./install.bash openziti-router
```

<LinuxPackageRepo />

## Bootstrapping

You can opt-in to generating a configuration file and enrolling the router automatically. You will be prompted for the most relevant configuration values when installing interactively unless the answer is already known.

Bootstrapping consists of these steps:

1. Generate a one-shot configuration file from env answers and defaults.
1. Enroll the router with the controller.

At a minimum, you must set these to opt-in to bootstrapping.

1. In **/opt/openziti/etc/router/service.env** (the answer file for the service)
    1. Set `ZITI_BOOTSTRAP=true`
1. In **/opt/openziti/etc/router/bootstrap.env** (the answer file for bootstrapping the router)
    1. Set `ZITI_CTRL_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS` to the FQDN of the controller
    1. Set `ZITI_ENROLL_TOKEN` to the resulting token (JWT)

Additionally, you probably want to set these:

1. In **/opt/openziti/etc/router/bootstrap.env** (the answer file for bootstrapping the router)
    1. Set `ZITI_ROUTER_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS` to the permanent FQDN of the router (default: localhost). This value can not be changed after enrollment.
    1. Set `ZITI_ROUTER_MODE` (default: none) if this router's built-in tunneler will provide a proxy for services. Mode `tproxy` requires additional kernel capabilities in **/etc/systemd/system/ziti-router.service.d/override.conf** and DNS resolver configuration for the host.

### Bootstrapping the Configuration

The router's configuration is loaded from a YAML file ([reference](/reference/30-configuration/router.md)). The Linux system service will generate a valid configuration during the first startup, unless one already exists. You can modify the generated configuration in **/var/lib/ziti-router/config.yml**.

The filename of the configuration file, relative to the router's working directory, is given as an argument, e.g., `entrypoint.bash run config.yml` in **/lib/systemd/system/ziti-router.service** as an argument to the `ExecStart` command. You may override this in **/etc/systemd/system/ziti-router.service.d/override.conf**.

Explore configuration option variables by running `ziti create config environment --help`. Any of these may be set in **/opt/openziti/etc/router/bootstrap.env** to influence the generated configuration.

Disable generating a configuration by setting `ZITI_BOOTSTRAP_CONFIG=false` in **/opt/openziti/etc/router/service.env**.

### Bootstrapping the Enrollment

You must provide an enrollment token. Obtain the token by administratively creating the router.

```text title="Create a router"
ziti edge create edge-router "AcmeRouter1" \
    --tunneler-enabled \
    --jwt-output-file path/to/token.jwt
```

[Learn more about managing routers with the CLI](/guides/deployments/10-linux/20-router/40-cli-mgmt.md).

The systemd service looks for the token in **/opt/openziti/etc/router/.token** if env var `ZITI_ENROLL_TOKEN` is empty. The file must be readable by root (not others).

`ZITI_ENROLL_TOKEN` may be defined in **/opt/openziti/etc/router/bootstrap.env**.

The router will enroll with the controller during the first startup. The one-time enrollment token is consumed during the enrollment process and a private key is generated in the router's working directory.

Disable bootstrapping enrollment by setting `ZITI_BOOTSTRAP_ENROLLMENT=false` in **/opt/openziti/etc/router/service.env**.

## Firewall

The router's generated configuration uses a single TCP port (default: `3022`) defined by `ZITI_ROUTER_PORT` in **/opt/openziti/etc/router/bootstrap.env**.

Confirm the router is running and listening on the expected port.

This will list all listening TCP ports for commands that contain "ziti" in their name.

```text
sudo ss -tlnp | grep ziti
```

If you have only one process named like "ziti" running, you will see output similar to this.

```buttonless title="Output"
LISTEN 0      4096                          *:3022             *:*    users:(("ziti",pid=2166302,fd=8))         
```

Verify the router is reachable and presents a server certificate from the controller's intermediate edge signer CA and the intermediate CA cert. Substitute the router's advertised address and port for `localhost:3022` with the advertised address in **/var/lib/ziti-router/config.yml**.

```text
openssl s_client -connect localhost:3022 -alpn ziti-edge -showcerts <>/dev/null \
|& openssl storeutl -certs -noout -text /dev/stdin \
| grep -E '(Subject|Issuer):'
```

## Logging

View the router service's output with `journalctl -u ziti-router.service`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="goformats" label="Log Formats">

Choose the logging format (default: text).

- `pfxlog` - a human-readable format leveraging ANSI escape codes to colorize log levels
- `json` - a machine-readable format targeting automated processes for log aggregation
- `text` - a human-readable format using plain text (no ANSI escape codes)

```text title="Run without colorized log levels"
ziti router run config.yml --log-formatter text
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="golevels" label="Log Levels">

The default log level is `INFO`. This means that log messages `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL` will all be emitted. Enable verbose logging by adding `--verbose or -v` to the command being executed. Verbose mode will additionally emit `DEBUG` log level messages.

```text title="Run the controller with verbose (DEBUG, 4) log level"
ziti router run config.yml --verbose
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Uninstall

1. Clean the Service State


    ```text
    sudo systemctl disable --now ziti-router.service
    sudo systemctl clean --what=state ziti-router.service
    ```

1. Purge the package, including configuration files.

    APT - Debian, Ubuntu, etc.

    ```text
    sudo apt-get purge openziti-router
    ```

    RPM - RedHat, Fedora, etc.

    ```text
    sudo dnf remove --purge openziti-router
    ```

1. Remove any firewall exceptions you created.
