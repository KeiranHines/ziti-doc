This article is about deploying a Ziti router as a Linux system service. [This page](/learn/introduction/03-components.md#openziti-router) provides an overview of the architecture.

Routers provide Ziti network entry and exit points for clients and smart routing through the mesh. You must have at least one router that is advertising an edge connection to clients. If you have more than one router, you must configure transport links between them to form the fabric mesh.

## Installation

The router package `openziti-router` provides a systemd service unit and optional bootstrapping. The package depends on the `openziti` package which provides the `ziti` CLI. The easiest way to install both is the cross-platform install script for RPM and Debian distributions.

```text
curl -sS https://get.openziti.io/install.bash \
| sudo bash -s openziti-router
```

## Bootstrapping

You can opt-in to generating a configuration file and enrolling the router automatically. You will be prompted for the most relevant configuration values when installing interactively unless the answer is already known.

Bootstrapping consists of these steps:

1. Generate a one-shot configuration file from env answers and defaults.
1. Enroll the router with the controller.

At a minimum, you must set these to opt-in to bootstrapping.

1. In `/opt/openziti/etc/router/service.env` (the answer file for the service)
    1. Set `ZITI_BOOTSTRAP=true`
1. In `/opt/openziti/etc/router/bootstrap.env` (the answer file for bootstrapping the router)
    1. Set `ZITI_ENROLL_TOKEN` to the resulting token (JWT)

Additionally, you probably want to set these:

1. In `/opt/openziti/etc/router/bootstrap.env` (the answer file for bootstrapping the router)
    1. Set `ZITI_CTRL_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS` to the FQDN of the controller (default: localhost).
    1. Set `ZITI_ROUTER_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS` to the permanent FQDN of the router (default: localhost). This value can not be changed after enrollment.
    1. Set `ZITI_ROUTER_MODE` (default: none) if this router's built-in tunneler will provide a proxy for services. Mode `tproxy` requires additional kernel capabilities in `/etc/systemd/system/ziti-router.service.d/override.conf` and DNS resolver configuration for the host.

### Bootstrapping the Configuration

The router's configuration is loaded from a YAML file ([reference](/reference/30-configuration/router.md)). The Linux system service will generate a valid configuration during the first startup, unless one already exists. You can modify the generated configuration in `/var/lib/ziti-router/config.yml`.

The filename of the configuration file, relative to the router's working directory, is given as an argument, e.g., `entrypoint.bash run config.yml` in `/lib/systemd/system/ziti-router.service` as an argument to the `ExecStart` command. You may override this in `/etc/systemd/system/ziti-router.service.d/override.conf`.

Explore configuration option variables by running `ziti create config environment --help`. Any of these may be set in `/opt/openziti/etc/router/bootstrap.env` to influence the generated configuration.

Disable generating a configuration by setting `ZITI_BOOTSTRAP_CONFIG=false` in `/opt/openziti/etc/router/service.env`.

### Bootstrapping the Enrollment

You must provide an enrollment token. Obtain the token by administratively creating the router.

```text title="Create a router"
ziti edge create edge-router "AcmeRouter1" \
    --tunneler-enabled \
    --jwt-output-file path/to/token.jwt
```

[Learn more about managing routers with the CLI](/guides/deployments/10-linux/20-router/40-cli-mgmt.md).

The systemd service looks for the token in `/opt/openziti/etc/router/.token` if env var `ZITI_ENROLL_TOKEN` is empty. The file must be readable by root (not others).

`ZITI_ENROLL_TOKEN` may be defined in `/opt/openziti/etc/router/bootstrap.env`.

The router will enroll with the controller during the first startup. The one-time enrollment token is consumed during the enrollment process and a private key is generated in the router's working directory.

Disable bootstrapping enrollment by setting `ZITI_BOOTSTRAP_ENROLLMENT=false` in `/opt/openziti/etc/router/service.env`.

## Firewall

The router listens on a single configurable TCP port: `3022/tcp`. Ziti clients use ALPN to negotiate a connection to the edge (`ziti-edge`), fabric links (`ziti-link`), or health-check APIs (`h2`, `http/1.1`).

You may set `ZITI_ROUTER_PORT` in `/opt/openziti/etc/router/bootstrap.env` to bootstrap with a different port.

Clients "learn" the router's address and port when they poll the controller for authorized routers, so it is not necessary to re-enroll or re-create the client if the router's address or port changes. Simply change the config, bounce the router, and it will begin advertising the new address and port. This works because the system service and Docker container both auto-renew their server certificate every startup, and the certificate's DNS subject alternative name is set in the router's config.yml file. If you set `ZITI_AUTO_RENEW_CERTS=false` then it's necessary to administratively re-create the router or run at least once with the `--extend` flag.

## Agent

The router provides an IPC agent for administration. The agent listens on a Unix domain socket inside the filesystem namespace of the router service. Here's an example for querying the router's agent for statistics.

```text
systemctl show -p MainPID --value ziti-router.service \
| xargs -rIPID sudo nsenter --target PID --mount -- \
    ziti agent stats
```

```buttonless title="Output"
goroutines: 38
OS threads: 20
GOMAXPROCS: 16
num CPU: 16
```

## Logging

View the router service's output with `journalctl -u ziti-router.service`.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="goformats" label="Log Formats">

Choose the logging format (default: text).

- `pfxlog` - a human-readable format leveraging ANSI escape codes to colorize log levels
- `json` - a machine-readable format targeting automated processes for log aggregation
- `text` - a human-readable format using plain text (no ANSI escape codes)

```text title="Run without colorized log levels"
ziti router run config.yml --log-formatter text
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="golevels" label="Log Levels">

The default log level is `INFO`. This means that log messages `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `FATAL` will all be emitted. Enable verbose logging by adding `--verbose or -v` to the command being executed. Verbose mode will additionally emit `DEBUG` log level messages.

```text title="Run the controller with verbose (DEBUG, 4) log level"
ziti router run config.yml --verbose
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Uninstall

```text
sudo systemctl disable --now ziti-router.service
sudo systemctl clean --what=state ziti-router.service
```
