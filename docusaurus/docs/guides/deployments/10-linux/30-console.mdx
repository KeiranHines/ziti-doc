The console can be bound to the same web listener as the controller's management API.

1. On the controller host, download the latest release of the console from GitHub. You can use any console version >= 3.0.0.

    ```text
    wget https://github.com/openziti/ziti-console/releases/latest/download/ziti-console.zip
    ```

1. Unzip the console in the controller's working directory.

    ```text
    sudo unzip -d /var/lib/ziti-controller/zac ./ziti-console.zip
    ```

1. Ensure you have an API binding `zac` on the same web listener where `edge-management` is bound. Ensure the `location` matches the path where you unzipped the console.

    ```text
    - binding: zac
      options:
        location: /var/lib/ziti-controller/zac
        indexFile: index.html
    ```

1. Restart the controller service to apply the changes.

    ```text
    sudo systemctl restart ziti-controller.service
    ```

1. Visit the controller's web address in a browser to access the console.

    ```text
    https://ziti.example.com:1280/zac
    ```

1. To set up a separate certificate for the console you must provide the certificate and key files in the controller's configuration YAML file in the `identity.alt_server_certs` property. Refer to [the configuration reference for the `identity` property](/reference/30-configuration/conventions.md#identity) for more information. You can skip this step if you want to use the console with the certificate that is already configured for the `edge-management` binding.
