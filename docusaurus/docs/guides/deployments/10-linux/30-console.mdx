The console can be bound to the same web listener as the controller's management API. The console is then accessed by navigating to the controller's web address.

1. On the controller host, download the latest release of the console from GitHub. You can use any console version >= 3.0.0.

    ```text
    wget https://github.com/openziti/ziti-console/releases/latest/download/ziti-console.zip
    ```

1. Unzip the console in the controller's working directory.

    ```text
    sudo unzip -d /var/lib/ziti-controller/zac ./ziti-console.zip
    ```

1. Add a new API binding `zac` to the same web listener where `edge-management` is bound. Set the `location`  option the relative path to unzipped console files.

    ```text
    
    - binding: zac
      options:
        location: ./zac
        indexFile: index.html
    ```

1. Restart the controller service to apply the changes.

    ```text
    sudo systemctl restart ziti-controller.service
    ```

1. Visit the controller's web address in a browser to access the console.

    ```text
    https://ziti.example.com:1280/zac
    ```

1. You can configure a server certificate (e.g., from LetsEncrypt) for the console by adding `alt_server_certs` to the web listener's `identity`. Refer to [the configuration reference for the `identity` property](/reference/30-configuration/conventions.md#identity) for more information.
