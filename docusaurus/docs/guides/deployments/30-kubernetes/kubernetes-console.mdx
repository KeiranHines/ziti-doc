Use the console by navigating to the controller's address with path `/zac/` in a web browser. If you published the controller at `ctrl.ziti.example.com:443`, then the console URL is `https://ctrl.ziti.example.com/zac/`.

The correct console URL is displayed after Helm install or upgrade and may be fetched at any time with Helm.

kubectl get secrets ziti-controller-admin-secret \

'{{range $k,$v := .data}}'\
'{{printf "%s: " $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v|base64decode}}{{end}}{{"\n"}}'\

:::note
The management API URL is the same as the client API URL unless you deployed the controller with `managementApi.service.enabled`, which "splits" the management API to have a separate URL.
