Use the console by navigating to the controller's address with path `/zac/` in a web browser. If you published the controller at `ziti.example.com:443`, then the console URL is `https://ziti.example.com/zac/`.

View the console URL in the Helm release notes.

```text title="Substitute your Helm release name for 'ziti-controller'"
helm get notes ziti-controller

:::note
The management API URL is the same as the client API URL unless you deployed the controller with `managementApi.service.enabled`, which "splits" the management API to have a separate URL.
