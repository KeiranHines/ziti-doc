This section contains operational guidance for specific tasks such as deploying a controller with Helm or as a Linux system service, backing up the controller's database, and migrating controller or router configurations.

## What is a Guide?

A guide is like a recipe. It's a type of documentation that is more advanced and solution-focused than other types. A guide is prescriptive and procedural. For example, "How to deploy a controller with Helm."

There's lots of room in here for new guides! Want guidance before you submit? Want someone else to submit? No problem. Follow the link to create a GitHub issue, label it "how-to", and tell us what you are working on.
