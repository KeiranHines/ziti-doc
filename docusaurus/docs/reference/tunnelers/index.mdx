title: Tunnellers
---

Each tunneller operates similarly. The goal is to have the tunneller seamlessly intercept traffic destined for Ziti
services and forward that traffic over the Ziti overlay instead of the [underlay](/reference/glossary.md#underlay) network. All processes on the host can access the Ziti services available to the tunneller's loaded identities.

A tunneller configures a Ziti nameserver for resolving Ziti service addresses and associated Ziti IP routes in a device's OS. These are quickly updated when a policy change alters the visible Ziti services for any loaded Ziti identity.
