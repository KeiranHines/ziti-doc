## Manual Installation

[The latest binary release](https://github.com/openziti/ziti-tunnel-sdk-c/releases/latest/) of `ziti-edge-tunnel` is
distributed as an executable binary in GitHub.


Unzip the downloaded file and copy the binary to a directory in your PATH, such as `/usr/local/bin`.

```text
sudo install -o root -g root ./ziti-edge-tunnel /usr/local/bin/
```

Create a POSIX group named `ziti` if it doesn't already exist. Members of this group can access the identity files and send IPC commands to the socket server.

```text
grep -q '^ziti:' /etc/group || sudo groupadd --system ziti
```

Create a directory to hold the identity files.

```text
sudo mkdir -pv /opt/openziti/etc/identities
```

### Run the Manually Installed Binary

You must run the manually installed tunneller as root because only the Linux package configures ambient
kernel capabilities that enable managing DNS and IP routes with reduced privileges.

```text
sudo ziti-edge-tunnel run --identity-dir /opt/openziti/etc/identities
```
