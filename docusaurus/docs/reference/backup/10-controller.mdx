## Backup

The best way to ensure continuity is to run multiple controllers. You can recover from the catastrophic loss of all
controllers in the cluster by creating a new single controller which can become the inaugural leader of a new cluster.

The three stateful aspects of the controller are the configuration YAML, PKI, and the
database. Ensure you back up all the files mentioned in the controller's configuration YAML file (keys, certs, root CA
bundle, and the database), and the config YAML file itself.

If you're using the Linux service you may accomplish this by triggering the database snapshot operation and backing up
the `/var/lib/ziti-controller` directory.

### Backing up the Configuration YAML

The controller's configuration YAML file is specified as a positional parameter when the controller is run. You can back
up this file or provide any valid controller configuration YAML to recover.

### Backing up the PKI Files

It is crucial to back up the irreplaceable root CAs. You can ease disaster recovery by issuing all leaf certificates
from an intermediate CA and securing the root CA on a different host. This ensures that all controllers' PKI files are
replaceable.

The controller issues leaf certificates during enrollment from its edge signer CA. If the edge signer is an
intermediate, then it's unnecessary to back up the intermediate CA cert or private key because every part of the system
is configured to trust the root. The controller's leaf certificate files must begin with the leaf and contain their
intermediate issuer chain. This configures the controller to present the partial chain during the TLS handshake,
allowing the other party to complete the chain with their copy of the root CA.

The following configuration properties refer to PKI files that must be backed up if not using an intermediate CA.

-   `identity` may appear in several places and always configures keys, leaf certs, and CA certs. When this property
    appears at the top level of the configuration YAML, its `ca` property has a special meaning and configures a bundle of
    root CAs that all parts of the network should trust.
-   `edge.enrollment.signingCert` always appears in one place and configures the controller's edge signer CA key and cert.

### Backing up the Database

The Controller uses a [Bolt](https://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt) database to store its state. If you have multiple
controllers you can back up the database of any member of the cluster and use the snapshot to initialize the inaugural
leader during recovery. It's not valuable to backup the databases of multiple members because you can only restore one
snapshot.

The database is a writeable file in a path specified by the controller's configuration property `db` ([link to config
reference](/reference/30-configuration/controller.md#db)).

Use the controller's built-in database snapshot operation to preserve data integrity. The snapshot operation creates a
snapshot file in the same filesystem directory as the main database file on the controller host, so you can periodically
back up the directory containing the configuration YAML and database and snapshots.

## Recovery

In a scenario where all controllers' states were lost, you can recover by restoring the configuration YAML, PKI, and
database to the inaugural leader of the recovered cluster.

### Recovering Configuration YAML

The path to the configuration file is a controller run parameter. You can restore the same configuration YAML file or
provide any valid controller configuration. It's not necessary to use the same filesystem paths on the new host, but the
configuration YAML must be edited to reflect the new paths if they change. You may use environment variables within the
configuration YAML for paths within the `db` and any `identity` blocks.

### Recovering PKI

The controller's configuration YAML file contains URIs for its private keys, leaf certificates, edge signer CA
certificate, and trust bundle. If the URI scheme is not specified it is interpreted as a `file://` URI, which may be
relative to the directory where the configuration YAML file is located or absolute.

You can restore these files from a backup, or, if using intermediate CA(s), you can instead generate new keys, issue a
new intermediate CA cert from the same root CA, and issue new leaf certificates from the new intermediate CA ([link to certificate renewal guide](/guides/troubleshooting/pki-troubleshooting/renew-cert.md)).

## Recovering the Database

If all controllers were lost then the inaugural leader of the new cluster or a singular controller can be initialized
with a database snapshot. Subsequent cluster members will synchronize their state with the new leader.

If you backed up the directory containing the active database and snapshots, ensure you restore the latest snapshot to
preserve data integrity. The backed-up active database file may not be internally consistent.
