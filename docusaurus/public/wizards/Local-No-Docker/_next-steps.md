## Next Steps

- Now that you have your network in place, you probably want to try it out. Head to
[the services quickstart](/docs/learn/quickstarts/services/) and start learning how to use OpenZiti.
- [Install the Ziti Console](/docs/learn/quickstarts/zac/#cloning-from-github) (web UI)
- Add a Second Public Router: In order for multiple routers to form transit links, they need a firewall exception to expose the "link listener" port. The default port is `10080/tcp`.
