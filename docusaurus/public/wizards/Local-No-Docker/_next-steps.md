## Next Steps

- Now that you have your network in place, you probably want to try it out. Head to
[the services quickstart](../services/index.md) and start learning how to use OpenZiti.
- [Install the Ziti Console](../zac/index.md#cloning-from-github) (web UI)
- Add a Second Public Router: In order for multiple routers to form transit links, they need a firewall exception to expose the "link listener" port. The default port is `10080/tcp`.
