Now that the controller is ready, you can start the edge router created with the 'express' process. You can start this router locally by running:

```
startRouter
```

Example output:

```
$ startRouter
Express Edge Router started as process id: 1296. log located at: /home/vagrant/.ziti/quickstart/bullseye/bullseye-edge-router.log
```

**If you would like to stop your Controller or Router at any point you can do so with the following commands:**

```
stopRouter 
stopController
```
