
An OpenZiti Tunneler is purpose-built software designed to connect applications which are not Ziti-aware to the OpenZiti Network. Ziti Tunnellers allow pre-existing, unmodified TCP/IP applications to access or provide services on a secure OpenZiti Network. An OpenZiti Tunneler cannot secure the communication between itself and the TCP/IP client or server application.
